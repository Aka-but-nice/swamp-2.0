A recreate of swamp for the latest version of iBoss, expect updates and always come back here for the update code, if I update this.
Steps:
1. You need bookmarklets, to check go to any tab and put ```javascript
javascript:alert("Testing")```
if you get an alert, you can continue, otherwise if you did not, you can not continue with the steps.
2. Bookmark this code ```javascript
javascript:fetch("https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Aka-unblock/swamp-2.0@main/swamp.js").then(e=>{e.text().then(f=>{eval(f)})})```
Go to https://tinyurl.com/bettergoofboss, click the link it will open a blank page, on that page run the bookmarklet you bookmarked.
